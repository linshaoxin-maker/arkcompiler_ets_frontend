  If we hover our mouse over x in an editor like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or the TypeScript Playground, weâ€™ll get a quick info panel that shows the type BasicPrimitive. Likewise, if we get the declaration file output (.d.ts output) for this file, TypeScript will say that doStuff returns BasicPrimitive.
