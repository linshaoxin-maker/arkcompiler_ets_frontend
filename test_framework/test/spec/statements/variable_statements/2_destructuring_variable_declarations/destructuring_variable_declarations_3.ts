description: >
  The type T associated with a binding property is determined as follows:
  Let S be the type associated with the immediately containing destructuring variable declaration, binding property, or binding element.
  If S is the Any type: 
  If the binding property specifies an initializer expression, T is the type of that initializer expression.
  Otherwise, T is the Any type.
  Let P be the property name specified in the binding property.
  If S has an apparent property with the name P, T is the type of that property.
  Otherwise, if S has a numeric index signature and P is a numerical name, T is the type of the numeric index signature.
  Otherwise, if S has a string index signature, T is the type of the string index signature.
  Otherwise, no type is associated with the binding property and an error occurs.
