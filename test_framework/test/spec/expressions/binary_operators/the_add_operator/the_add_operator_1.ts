 description: >
  The binary + operator requires both operands to be of the Number primitive type or an enum type, 
  or at least one of the operands to be of type Any or the String primitive type. 
  Operands of an enum type are treated as having the primitive type Number. 
  If one operand is the null or undefined value, it is treated as having the type of the other operand.
