  In a destructuring assignment expression, the type of the expression on the right must be assignable to the assignment target on the left.
  An expression of type S is considered assignable to an assignment target V if V is an array assignment pattern, 
  for each assignment element E in V, S is a tuple-like type with a property named N of a type that is assignable to the target given in E, 
  where N is the numeric index of E in the array assignment pattern.
