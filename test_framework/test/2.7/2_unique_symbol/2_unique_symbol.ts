// Works
declare const Foo: unique symbol;

// unique symbol is a subtype of symbol, and are produced only from calling Symbol() or Symbol.for(), or from explicit type annotations. 
const Bar: unique symbol = Symbol();
const Bar2: unique symbol = Symbol.for("Bar2");

// Works - refers to a unique symbol, but its identity is tied to 'Foo'.
// in order to reference a specific unique symbol, youâ€™ll have to use the typeof operator. 
let Baz: typeof Bar = Bar;
let Baz2: typeof Bar2 = Bar2;

// Also works.
class C {
  static readonly StaticSymbol: unique symbol = Symbol();
}

Assert.isTrue('symbol' === typeof Baz);
Assert.isTrue('symbol' === typeof Baz2);
Assert.isTrue('symbol' === typeof C.StaticSymbol);
