#  ``Symbol()`` API is not supported

Rule ``arkts-no-symbol``

**Severity: error**

TypeScript has ``Symbol()`` API, which can be used among other things to generate
unique property names at runtime. ArkTS does not support ``Symbol()`` API
because its most popular use cases make no sense in the statically typed
environment. In particular, the object layout is defined at compile time,
and cannot be changed at runtime.

``Symbol.iterator`` and iterable interfaces are not supported either.
Use arrays and library-level containers to iterate over data.


## TypeScript


```

    const sym = Symbol()
    let o = {
       [sym]: "value"
    }

    let obj = {
        data: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
        [Symbol.iterator]() {
            const this_ = this
            let index = 0
            return {
                next() {
                    return {
                        done: index >= this_.data.length,
                        value: 'name_' + this_.data[index++]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    for (let t of obj) {
        console.log(t)
    }

```

## ArkTS


```

    class SomeClass {
        public someProperty : string = ""
    }
    let o = new SomeClass()

    let arr:string[] = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    for (let t of arr) {
        console.log('name_' + t)
    }

```
