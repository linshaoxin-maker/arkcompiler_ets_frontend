description：The Symbol() API in TypeScript is used to generate unique property names at runtime. Since the common use cases of this API do not make sense in statically typed languages, ArkTS does not support the Symbol() API. In ArkTS, the object layout is determined at compile time and cannot be changed at runtime.
