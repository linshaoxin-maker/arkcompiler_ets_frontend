We define a  class named 'Car' and use the 'CarCtor' type to describe the constructor type. We then define a 'createCar' function that takes a constructor and the corresponding arguments and returns a 'Car' instance. Finally, we use the createCar function to create an instance of the Car, print out its property values, and call the startEngine method.
