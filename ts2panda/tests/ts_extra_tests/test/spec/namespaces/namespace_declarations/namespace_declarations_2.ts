 description: >
    namespaces are either instantiated or non-instantiated. A non-instantiated namespace is a namespace containing only interface types, type aliases, and other non-instantiated namespace. 
    an instantiated namespace is a namespace that doesn't meet this definition. In intuitive terms, an instantiated namespace is one for which a namespace instance is created, whereas a non-instantiated namespace is one for which no code is generated.
