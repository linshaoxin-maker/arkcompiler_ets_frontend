 description: >
    the Async Iteration introduces an AsyncIterator, which is similar to Iterator. The difference lies in the fact that the next, return, and throw methods of an AsyncIterator return a Promise for the iteration result, rather than the result itself. 
    this allows the caller to enlist in an asynchronous notification for the time at which the AsyncIterator has advanced to the point of yielding a value.

    lib: es2015
 module: ESNext
