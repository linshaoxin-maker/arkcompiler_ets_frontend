 description: >
  A type guard of the form 'x instanceof C', where x is not of type Any, 
  C is of a subtype of the global type 'Function', and C has a property named 'prototype',
  when true, narrows the type of x to the type of the 'prototype' property in C provided it is a subtype of the type of x,
  or, if the type of x is a union type, removes from the type of x all constituent types that aren't subtypes of the type of the 'prototype' property in C, 
  or when false, has no effect on the type of x.
