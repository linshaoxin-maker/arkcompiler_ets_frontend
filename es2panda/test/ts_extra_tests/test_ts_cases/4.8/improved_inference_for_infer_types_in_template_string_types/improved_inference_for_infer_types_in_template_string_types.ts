 description: >
    typescript recently introduced a way to add extends constraints to infer type variables in conditional types.
    if these infer types appear in a template string type and are constrained to a primitive type, TypeScript will now try to parse out a literal type.
    this can now better convey what a library will do at runtime, and give more precise types.
