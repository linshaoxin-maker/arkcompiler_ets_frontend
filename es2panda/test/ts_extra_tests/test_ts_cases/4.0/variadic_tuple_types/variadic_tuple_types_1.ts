 description: >
  The first change is that spreads in tuple type syntax can now be generic. 
  This means that we can represent higher-order operations on tuples and arrays even when we don’t know the actual types we’re operating over. 
  When generic spreads are instantiated (or, replaced with a real type) in these tuple types, they can produce other sets of array and tuple types.
