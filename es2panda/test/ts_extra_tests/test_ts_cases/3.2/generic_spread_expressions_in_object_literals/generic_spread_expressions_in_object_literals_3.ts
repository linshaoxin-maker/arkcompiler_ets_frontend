 description: >
    Non-generic spread expressions continue to be processed as before: Call and construct signatures are stripped, 
    only non-method properties are preserved, and for properties with the same name, the type of the rightmost property is used.
    This contrasts with intersection types which concatenate call and construct signatures, 
    preserve all properties, and intersect the types of properties with the same name.
    Thus, spreads of the same types may produce different results when they are created through instantiation of generic types
