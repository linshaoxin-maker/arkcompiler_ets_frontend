 description: >
    BigInts are part of an upcoming proposal in ECMAScript that allow us to model theoretically arbitrarily large integers. 
    Brings type-checking for BigInts, as well as support for emitting BigInt literals when targeting esnext.
    BigInt support in TypeScript introduces a new primitive type called the 'bigint' (all lowercase). 
    You can get a bigint by calling the BigInt() function or by writing out a BigInt literal by adding an n to the end of any integer numeric litera.
 options: 
    target: es2020
 module: ESNext
 isCurrent: true
