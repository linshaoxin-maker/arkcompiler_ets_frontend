 description: >
  In the signature of a function implementation, a parameter can be marked optional by following it with an initializer.
  When a parameter declaration includes both a type annotation and an initializer, the initializer expression is contextually typed by the stated type 
  and must be assignable to the stated type, or otherwise a compile-time error occurs. 
  When a parameter declaration has no type annotation but includes an initializer, 
  the type of the parameter is the widened form (section 3.12) of the type of the initializer expression
