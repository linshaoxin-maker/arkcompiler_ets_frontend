 description: >
    an EnumDeclaration introduces a named type and a named value in the containing declaration space. 
    The enum type is a distinct subtype of the Number primitive type. 
    the enum object is a value of an anonymous object type containing a set of properties, 
    all of the enum type, corresponding to the values declared for the enum type in the body of the declaration. 
    The enum object's type furthermore includes a numeric index signature with the signature '[x: number]: string'.
