 description: >
     in a constant enum declaration, all members must have constant values and it is an error for a member declaration to specify an expression that isn't classified as a constant enum expression.
     it is an error to reference a constant enum object in any other context than a property access that selects one of the enum's members. 
     the only permitted references to the enum object are those that are replaced with an enum member value.
