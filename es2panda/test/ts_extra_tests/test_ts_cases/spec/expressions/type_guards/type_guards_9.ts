  A type guard of the form typeof x === s, where s is a string literal with the value 'string', 'number', or 'boolean',
  when true, narrows the type of x to the given primitive type provided it is a subtype of the type of x, 
  or, if the type of x is a union type, removes from the type of x all constituent types that aren't subtypes of the given primitive type, 
  or when false, removes the primitive type from the type of x.
