  The '|' operator require its operands to be of type Any, the Number primitive type, or an enum type. 
  Operands of an enum type are treated as having the primitive type Number. 
  If one operand is the null or undefined value, it is treated as having the type of the other operand. 
  The result is always of the Number primitive type.
