   An assignment of the form 'v = expr' requires v to be classified as a reference or as an assignment pattern.
   The expr expression is contextually typed by the type of v, and the type of expr must be assignable to the type of v,
   or otherwise a compile-time error occurs. The result is a value with the type of expr.
