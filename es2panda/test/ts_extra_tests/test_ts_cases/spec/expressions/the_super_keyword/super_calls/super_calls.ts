 description: > 
    The super keyword can be used in expressions to reference base  class properties and the base class constructor.
    Super calls consist of the keyword super followed by an argument list enclosed in parentheses. 
    Super calls are only permitted in constructors of derived classes, as described in section 8.3.2.
    A super call invokes the constructor of the base class on the instance referenced by this. 
    A super call is processed as a function call (section 4.15) using the construct signatures of the base class constructor function type 
    as the initial set of candidate signatures for overload resolution. 
    The type of a super call expression is Void.
    The JavaScript code generated for a super call is specified in section 8.7.2.
