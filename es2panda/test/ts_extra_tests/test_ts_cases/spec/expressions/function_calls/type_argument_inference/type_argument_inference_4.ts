  If e is an expression of a function type that contains exactly one generic call signature and no other members, 
  and T is a function type with exactly one non-generic call signature and no other members, 
  then any inferences made for type parameters referenced by the parameters of T's call signature are fixed, 
  and e's type is changed to a function type with e's call signature instantiated in the context of T's call signature.
