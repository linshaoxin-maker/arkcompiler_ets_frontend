 description: >
    The compile-time processing of a typed function call consists,
    a list of candidate signatures is constructed from the call signatures in the function type in declaration order.
    A generic signature is a candidate in a function call with type arguments when the signature has the same number of type parameters 
    as were supplied in the type argument list, the type arguments satisfy their constraints, 
    and once the type arguments are substituted for their associated type parameters, 
    the signature is applicable with respect to the argument list of the function call.
