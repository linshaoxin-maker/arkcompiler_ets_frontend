    if T is a union or intersection type:
    First, inferences are made from S to each constituent type in T 
    that isn't simply one of the type parameters for which inferences are being made.
    If the first step produced no inferences then 
    if T is a union type and exactly one constituent type in T is simply a type parameter for which inferences are being made, 
    inferences are made from S to that type parameter.
    Otherwise, if S is a union or intersection type, inferences are made from each constituent type in S to T.
