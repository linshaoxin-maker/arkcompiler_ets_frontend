 description: >
  The type T of a variable introduced by a simple variable declaration is determined as follows:
  If the declaration includes a type annotation, T is that type.
  Otherwise, if the declaration includes an initializer expression, T is the widened form (section 3.12) of the type of the initializer expression.
  Otherwise, T is the Any type.
