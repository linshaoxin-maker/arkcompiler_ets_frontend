 description: >
    the new.target meta-property is new syntax introduced in ES2015. When an instance of a constructor is created via new, the value of new.target is set to be a reference to the constructor function initially used to allocate the instance. 
    if a function is called rather than constructed via new, new.target is set to undefined.
 options:
    lib: es2015
 module: ESNext
 isCurrent: true
