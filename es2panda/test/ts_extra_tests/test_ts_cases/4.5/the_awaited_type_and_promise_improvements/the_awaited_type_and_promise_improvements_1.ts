 description: >
    TypeScript 4.5 introduces a new utility type called the Awaited type. 
    This type is meant to model operations like await in async functions,
    or the .then() method on Promises - specifically, the way that they recursively unwrap Promises;
    some of the problems around inference with Promise.all served as motivations for Awaited.
