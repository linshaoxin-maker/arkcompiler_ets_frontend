 description: >
  If a value with a union enum type is compared with a numeric literal that it could never be equal to, 
  then the type-checker will issue an error.
  As a workaround, you can re-write an annotation to include the appropriate literal type.
  You can also use a type-assertion on the value.
  Alternatively, you can re-declare your enum to have a non-trivial initializer so that any number is both assignable and comparable to that enum.
